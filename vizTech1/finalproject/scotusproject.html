                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>The Supreme Court's primary role is to enforce the laws of the legislative branch. Its eight justices have the discretion to select and hear cases on a variety of issues. Some of the cases seek to push the interpretation of laws beyond
                        their widely understood intent and have a lasting impact on the legacy and role of the Court. Cases discussing privacy, for example, have gone beyond enforcing the rights of privacy and instead propelled both the rights and freedoms
                        of LGBTQIA+ and Women's movements forward. Despite the benefits of the social progress of these movements, if used too liberally, this power gives these eight unelected justices broad unchecked power.</p>

            <h2 class="lowerTitle">Analysis</h2>
            <p>Rationally, the Court's role to protect property and safety are at the
                fundamental core of our rule of law society&mdash; the data shows that these have been the issues most frequently
                reviewed in Supreme Court cases: 1) Criminal Procedure followed by 2) Economic Activity.
                The court has adjudicated far fewer cases that fundamentally change our rights
                and protections related to, for example, free speech and organized labor. Through these cases, 
                the Court tends to enforce the status quo set by the founders and the elected, representative legislative branch.
            </p>

            <p>However, one issue area that the Court has substantially activated is Civil Rights. Moving beyond, existing laws, 
                the Court's have created then enforced catalytic Civil Rights that previously didn't exist. 
                Given the high percentage of cases reviewed in the Civil Rights issue area, as the third most
                deliberated issue area in the Court to-date, the protection of Civil Rights can be attributed
                as a primary function of the Court. These data reflect a common thought that the Supreme Court
                is in fact an <i>"Activist Court"</i> that creates its own laws and furthers social movement,
                progress, or change. From affirmative action and integration to voting rights and jurisdiction
                limitations over indigenous peoples the Court has played a powerful role in our society, despite
                being removed from the democratic election system required by
                our other branches of government.
            </p>

            <p>While the Court remains true to its function as the constitution's guardian,
                the Court has exercised its power as interpreter to adjudicate beyond the scope of existing
                agreed upon laws. As parties continue to change and the country becomes increasing divided,
                this unchecked power has an unstable stronghold on our democracy.
