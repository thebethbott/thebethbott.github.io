                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Supreme Court and its eight justices hear cases on a variety of issues ranging from 
                    protecting statesâ€™ rights to privacy. Both issues have been linked with larger social 
                    movements (the conservative right and the LGBTQIA+ and Women's movements respectively). <br />
                    <br />Justices select the specific cases they will hear in a given term and their discretion has 
                    a lasting impact on the legacy of the Court. As a way to understand the distribution of 
                    Judicial power towards progress on these issues, below we compare the number of cases that 
                    focus on each issue area.</p></div>

            <h2 class="lowerTitle">Analysis</h2>
            <p>Rationally property and safety are at the fundamental core of any rule of law society, 
            and Judicial power is the organizing principal by which both are determined&mdash; logically 
            these are the primary areas of focus. Far fewer cases fundamentally change our rights and 
            protections in areas elsewhere in our lives such as our ability to <strong>speak without judicial 
            consequence</strong> and our ability to <strong>organize labor movements</strong>. 
            <br /><br />However, when we look to determine if a primary function of the Court has been to pursue 
            activist social movements, we cannot deny that a primary function of the Court is also Civil Rights 
            which range broadly from affirmative action and integration to voting rights and jurisdiction limitations over indigenous peoples. 
            <br /><br />While the Court remains true to its function in the constitution, simply as enforcement over 
            policy determine by the legislature, <strong>by pushing the boundaries of the interpretations of the 
            constitution, it also has in fact exercised its power to adjudicate beyond the scope of existing 
            agreed upon laws</strong>. </p> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
