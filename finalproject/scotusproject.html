        <h1>Issue Prevalence in the U.S. Supreme Court</h1>
        <p>
        <h2 style="italic"> 
            "The Court is the highest tribunal in the Nation for all cases and controversies arising under the Constitution or the laws of the United States. As the final arbiter of the law, the Court is charged with ensuring the American people the promise of equal justice under law and, thereby, also functions as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution." </h2></p>

            The Supreme Court and its eight justices hear cases on a variety of issues ranging from protecting statesâ€™ rights to privacy. Both issues have been linked with larger social movements (the conservative right and the LGBTQIA+ and Women's movements respectively). Justices select the specific cases they will hear in a given term and their discretion has a lasting impact on the legacy of the Court. As a way to understand the distribution of Judicial power towards progress on these issues, below we compare the number of cases that focus on each issue area.</h2>

        <h3>Three of the primary topic areas include 1) Economic activity (such as cases of wage arbitration, bankruptcy, property claims, and corruption) 2) Criminal procedure (such as cruel and unusual punishment, right to council, and illegal search and seizure) and 3) Judicial power (such as jurisdiction, certiorari and mootness) are at the forefront of the cumulative caseload of the Court. Rationally property and safety are at the fundamental core of any rule of law society, and Judicial power is the organizing principal by which both are determined- logically these are the primary areas of focus. Far fewer cases fundamentally change our rights and protections in areas elsewhere in our lives such as our ability to speak without judicial consequence and our ability to organize labor movements. However, when we look to determine if a primary function of the Court has been to pursue activist social movements, we cannot deny that a primary function of the Court is also Civil Rights which range broadly from affirmative action and integration to voting rights and jurisdiction limitations over indigenous peoples. While the Court remains true to its function in the constitution, simply as enforcement over policy determine by the legislature, by pushing the boundaries of the interpretations of the constitution, it also has in fact exercised its power to adjudicate beyond the scope of existing agreed upon laws.</h3>
