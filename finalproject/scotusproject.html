                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Supreme Court's primary role is to maintain the status quo by enforcing the laws of the 
                    legislative branch. Its eight justices have the discretion to hear cases on a variety of issues. 
                    Some of the cases they choose to hear, seek to push the interpretation of laws beyond maintaining the status 
                    quo and have a lasting impact on the legacy of the Court and the course our society.
                    Cases discussing privacy, for example, have altered the course of history propelling both 
                    the LGBTQIA+ and Women's movements forward. If used too liberally, this power gives these eight unelected 
                    officials broad unchecked power.</p> </div>

            <h2 class="lowerTitle">Analysis</h2>
            <p>Rationally to maintain the status quo, the Court's role to protect property and safety are at the 
                fundamental core of our rule of law society&mdash; logically these have been the issues most frequently 
                reviewed in Supreme Court cases: 1) Criminal Procedure followed by 2) Economic Activity. 
                The court has adjudicated far fewer cases that fundamentally change our rights 
                and protections related to, for example, free speech and organized labor.

            <br /><br />However, one issue area that has substantially impacted our social order is Civil Rights. 
            Given the high percentage of cases reviewed in the Civil Rights issue area, as the third most deliberated 
            issue area in the Court to-date, the protection of Civil Rights can be attributed as a primary function 
            of the Court. 
            These data reflect a common thought that the Supreme Court is in fact an <i>"Activist Court"</i> that 
            creates its own laws and furthers social movement, progress, or change. From affirmative action and 
            integration to voting rights and jurisdiction limitations over indigenous peoples the Court has played 
            a powerful role in our society, despite being removed from the democratic election system required by 
            our other branches of government. 

            <br /><br />While the Court remains true to its function as the constitution's guardian, 
            the Court has exercised its power as interpreter to adjudicate beyond the scope of existing 
            agreed upon laws. As parties continue to change and the country becomes increasing divided,
            this unchecked power has an unstable stronghold on our democracy. </p> <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
